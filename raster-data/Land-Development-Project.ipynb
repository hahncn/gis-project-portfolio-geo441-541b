Darker shades of pink correlate with higher numbers of endangered species in a given area. Land development, although not visible on a national scale due to the raster resolution, was most often clustered around previously developed areas, i.e. highly populated cities. Miami and Las Vegas were selected for a close-up due to the differing relationships between land development and imperiled species richness around each city."

The greater Las Vegas area saw lots of land development that does not overlap with high numbers of endangered species. There are scattered areas of higher imperiled species richness to the west of Las Vegas, but almost none overlapping the development itself."

However, there are many factors to consider in regards to biodiversity, such as species richness and biome. Perhaps Florida simply has higher species richness than Nevada and therefore will have a higher number of endangered species. Since this endangered species richness data is presented as raw numbers rather than rates (compared to total number of species present), this relationship is difficult to determine.\n",
